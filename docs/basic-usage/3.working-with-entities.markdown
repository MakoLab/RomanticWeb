# Create entity context

Now that we have a entity context factory created in the previous step it is time to create an entity context. It is as
simple as calling one method.

``` java
var context = contextFactory.CreateContext();
```

## Creating entities

We are now ready to start creating some data. Here's how we create a new entity and populate it with some data

``` java
// create an entity
var tim = context.Create<IPerson>(new Uri("Tim-Berners-Lee"));

// set some properties
tim.Name = "Tim";
tim.LastName = "Berners-Lee";

// commit data to store
context.Commit();
```

This will create some triples describing sir Tim Berners-Lee (assuming mappings from the previous page)

``` css
<Tim-Berners-Lee>
    foaf:givenName "Tim" ;
    foaf:LastName "Berners-Lee" .
```

You may notice that for simplicity relative URIs are used. This is totally supported by Romantic Web, but requires
configuration. Please read more on the detailed page about entity context factory configuration.

## Loading entities

The entity context is also used to retrieve entities. Its interface exposes a generic `Load` method, which creates an
instance of the given entity type.

For example later on we may want to associate sir Tim Berners-Lee with another person we create.

``` java
var norman = context.Create<IPerson>(new Uri("Norman-Walsh"));
var tim = context.Load<IPerson>(new Uri("Tim-Berners-Lee"));

tim.Knows.Add(norman);

context.Commit();
```

This would assert the following triple in the store

``` css
<Tim-Berners-Lee> foaf:knows <Norman-Walsh> .
```

## Deleting entities

Lastly of course there is a `Delete` method, which removes all triples about a given entity. Because entity data is
partitioned in Named Graphs, deletion simply removes whole graphs. This means that there are no blank nodes orphaned if
the resource had any in its representation. The usage is a s simple as

``` java
EntityId identifier = new Uri("Tim-Berners-Lee");
context.Delete(identifier);
```

And if you have an entity instance you'd do

``` java
IPerson tim = //...
context.Delete(tim.Id);
```
