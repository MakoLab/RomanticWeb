# Installation

## Main package

RomanticWeb is available on [NuGet][nuget]. The easiest way to include it in your project is to execute

    install-package RomanticWeb

in the Package Manager Console.

Alternatively you could install the package using the Manage Packages screen.

## Storage backend

RomanticWeb is not tightly coupled to any storage backend to potentially allow implementing customized data access
layers. Currently the only implemented storage is using [dotNetRDF][dotNetRDF] and it is available as a separate
NuGet package.

    install-package RomanticWeb.dotNetRDF

Thanks to dotNetRDF it is possible to use a single component to access a wide variety of supported triple stores such as [Virtuoso][Virtuoso], [Allegro Graph][allegro] or [Stardog][stardog]. For a full list please refer to the project's [wiki pages][dnr storage].

## JSON-LD

Last but not least Romantic Web comes with its own [JSON-LD][jsonld] processor implementation for .NET.

    install-package RomanticWeb.JsonLd

Please not that JSON-LD support is not currently complete.
